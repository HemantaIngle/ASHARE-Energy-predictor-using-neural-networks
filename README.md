Increasing power consumption means increase in the cost and loss of money, when it comes to the power consumption in a residential or a commercial building use of electricity is inevitable but there are means of reducing the usage of power by intelligent technologies. Power saving achieved can only be tested when you actually implement [3] the new power saving techniques but is there any way that we can estimate the power savings before the power saving technique has already been implemented?  Or is there a way we can predict the power consumption without the power saving technique being implemented and compare it with the model when power saving is implemented, the answer is yes, we can use algorithms from like Machine learning and Artificial intelligence by which we can predict the power. This is our aim in this project.
Motivation/Challenge- the 1st motivation comes from the fact that it is going to save power and hence save the environment. The second is the when better estimates of power saving are predicted then investors will come forth in investing in this area.

Current Methods- there are current methods of estimating power but they are fragmented means that they are not on a uniform scale so a fair comparison is not possible


Possible Solution-we have now successfully identified the problem and also have come up with an idea to use Neural networks for power prediction. [4] Algorithms can be developed that make accurate predictions for consumed power by training the model on basis of data available from more than 1000 buildings collected over a span of 3 years and also considering the weather.

Evaluation metric –
Evaluation metric determines the performance of a particular model and allows us to choose a perfect model with the best performance so for this competition  the metric is RMSLE (Root mean square logarithmic error ) that is a simple log extension of a RMS (Root Mean Square) – as the data is too large an so are the differences in order that a proper scale is maintained the metric is evaluated on a Logarithmic scale.
