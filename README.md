Increasing power consumption means increase in the cost and loss of money, when it comes to the power consumption in a residential or a commercial building use of electricity is inevitable but there are means of reducing the usage of power by intelligent technologies. Power saving achieved can only be tested when you actually implement [3] the new power saving techniques but is there any way that we can estimate the power savings before the power saving technique has already been implemented?  Or is there a way we can predict the power consumption without the power saving technique being implemented and compare it with the model when power saving is implemented, the answer is yes, we can use algorithms from like Machine learning and Artificial intelligence by which we can predict the power. This is our aim in this project.
